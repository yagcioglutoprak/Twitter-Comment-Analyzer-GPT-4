Here's how it works:

1. First, enter the tweet ID of the tweet you want to analyze.
2. Our script then uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract all the comments on the tweet.
3. The comments are then preprocessed to remove any URLs, punctuations, and converted to lowercase.
4. The preprocessed comments are then fed into OpenAI's language model, where it generates a text that explains the general idea of all the comments.
5. And voila! You now have a summarized version of all the comments on the tweet.

*Note: If the main tweet has an image, our script also uses image recognition to generate a text representation of the image. The text representation is then included in the prompt to OpenAI, providing additional context for the summary.
